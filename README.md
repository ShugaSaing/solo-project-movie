Microsoft should not immediately attempt to create a movie on their own, as the procedure is frequently hard and requires significant skill. Alternatively, Microsoft should collaborate with an established studio production business to ensure the finest quality of the film. Blumhouse and Paramount/Dreamworks are two leading production companies with a plethora of experience and understanding in the film industry. Microsoft can secure the film's success by forming a partnership with one of these companies and leveraging their knowledge in the production process.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120557915/224435570-02a04b06-8167-4afd-8d87-88fc12afb73d.png)
A film's running time is also an important factor in its overall success. According to the results, movies that are 100 to 150 minutes long have the best chance of being commercially efficacious. This is due to the fact that movies with longer running times provide more chances for spectators investment in the protagonist, the antagonist, and any secondary characters. On the other side, a convincing narrative and engaging tale may be missing in a shorter film's runtime. Microsoft can assure the commercial success of its movies if they are between 100 and 150 minutes in duration.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120557915/224435593-10054ed0-c29f-4f9e-984f-a1f0fc361e56.png)
